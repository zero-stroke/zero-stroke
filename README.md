### Hi there 👋

### I like to code 
The programs I made are usually related to finance. Python is usually what I use, but sometimes I use C or Java. Other than programming, I like economics, finance, nutrition, and movies. 


- 🔭 I’m currently working on building finance and economics tools
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how LSTMs work
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything finance related
- 💬 Ask me about any of my repositories
- 📫 How to reach me: Discord 
- ⚡ Fun fact: My favorite movie is The Big Lebowski
